# AssetVault: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Permission Matrix

**Course:** BCSE307L Database Systems (Fall 2026-27)  
**System Architecture:** Multi-Tenant Relational SaaS with Single `users` Table  
**Source of Truth:** Defined here and programmatically enforced via `apps/api/src/config/permissions.ts`.

---

## 1. Architectural Principles of AssetVault RBAC

1. **Single Unified `users` Directory:**
   - AssetVault strictly avoids separate tables for admins, managers, and members (`no admin_users or tenant_members tables`).
   - Every human account resides in the unified `users` table linked via foreign key to `roles(id)`.
   - The role name (`SUPER_ADMIN`, `TENANT_ADMIN`, `ASSET_MANAGER`, `MEMBER`) is encoded into signed JWT claims, but **the user is re-loaded from PostgreSQL on every authenticated request** (`loadUser` middleware) to guarantee that role revocations or account suspensions take effect with zero latency.

2. **Strict Multi-Tenant Boundary:**
   - `SUPER_ADMIN` is a platform-level infrastructure operator (`users.tenant_id IS NULL`). The Super Admin can govern tenant accounts, configure subscription plans, and inspect global health analytics, but has **zero access to view, download, or manipulate any tenant's proprietary digital assets or license agreements**.
   - `TENANT_ADMIN`, `ASSET_MANAGER`, and `MEMBER` are strictly scoped to their respective tenant organization (`users.tenant_id = tenants.id`).

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
   - Route authorization is enforced via middleware using granular permissions (`authorize('permission_name')`).
   - If an unauthenticated user attempts access, the API returns `401 Unauthorized`.
   - If an authenticated user lacks the necessary permission, the API returns `403 Forbidden` with the standard error response shape `{ error: { code: 'FORBIDDEN', message: '...' } }`.
   - If an authenticated user attempts to probe a resource ID belonging to another tenant, the API returns `404 Not Found` (never `403`), preventing ID enumeration attacks.

## 3. Role Responsibilities Breakdown

### `SUPER_ADMIN`
- **Scope:** Global SaaS Platform.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Create and manage customer tenants (`tenants:manage_platform`).
  - Configure subscription plans, asset quotas, and monthly prices (`plans:manage`).
  - Inspect platform-wide utilization via `v_tenant_summary`.
  - **Hard Security Constraint:** No access to tenant business data (cannot read or download assets, view license keys, or allocate seats).

### `TENANT_ADMIN`
- **Scope:** Single Tenant Organization.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Full administrative governance of their tenant domain.
  - User management: inviting new colleagues, assigning roles, deactivating departing staff (`users:manage`).
  - Vendor relationship management and commercial software licenses.
  - Full inspection of tamper-evident audit logs (`audit:read`).

### `ASSET_MANAGER`
- **Scope:** Single Tenant Organization.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Daily asset stewardship and catalog classification.
  - Uploading new asset files and iterating versions with SHA-256 integrity verification (`versions:create`).
  - Associating covering licenses to assets (`licenses:link_asset`).
  - Allocating seat entitlements to team members via `sp_allocate_license_seat`.
  - **Constraint:** Cannot manage team users or view the organization audit log.

### `MEMBER`
- **Scope:** Single Tenant Organization.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Browsing the approved digital asset catalog (`assets:read`).
  - Downloading authorized assets (`assets:download`), which automatically creates an entry in `asset_access_logs`.
  - Self-service license seat checkout (`allocations:checkout_self`) when capacity is available.
  - Viewing assigned seats and releasing them upon project completion (`allocations:release_self`).

## 4. UI Navigation Menu Provisioning (`GET /api/auth/menu`)

The backend dynamically serves role-based navigation menus through `GET /api/auth/menu`, ensuring that UI sidebars only render pages that match the user's explicit permissions:

```json
[
  { "key": "dashboard", "label": "Dashboard", "path": "/dashboard", "icon": "LayoutDashboard" },
  { "key": "assets", "label": "Asset Catalog", "path": "/assets", "icon": "FolderGit2" },
  { "key": "licenses", "label": "Licenses", "path": "/licenses", "icon": "KeyRound" },
  { "key": "allocations", "label": "My Seats", "path": "/allocations", "icon": "UserCheck" },
  { "key": "team", "label": "Team Members", "path": "/team", "icon": "Users", "requiredRole": ["TENANT_ADMIN"] },
  { "key": "vendors", "label": "Vendors", "path": "/vendors", "icon": "Building2", "requiredRole": ["TENANT_ADMIN", "ASSET_MANAGER"] },
  { "key": "audit", "label": "Audit Ledger", "path": "/audit", "icon": "ShieldCheck", "requiredRole": ["TENANT_ADMIN"] },
  { "key": "tenants", "label": "Tenant Management", "path": "/admin/tenants", "icon": "Server", "requiredRole": ["SUPER_ADMIN"] },
  { "key": "plans", "label": "Subscription Plans", "path": "/admin/plans", "icon": "CreditCard", "requiredRole": ["SUPER_ADMIN"] }
]
```
